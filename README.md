# Telamon

#### Description:
Telamon is an import of a classic mansion map from the game, ROBLOX. Beware, although the mansion may appear small on the exterior, it is a vast network of rooms. Those who explore them can end up walking away, but know you are also not the only salvagers... It's advised to play this with friends.

#### Difficulty: S (Similar to Rend)
