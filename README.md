# Telamon

#### Description:
Telamon is an import of a classic mansion map from the game, ROBLOX. Beware, although the mansion may appear small on the exterior, it is a vast network of rooms. Those who explore them can end up walking away with higher valued scraps, but know you are also not the only salvagers... It's advised to play this with friends.

#### Difficulty: S (Similar to Rend)
